## CS-499 Final Project - Southern New Hampshire University
## Introduction: Self-Assessment

Throughout the Computer Science program I have learned a significant amount. This program has challenged me in many different ways, and has given me the tools for a great career in Computer Science. Learning programming languages is a significant undertaking, and I have gained a solid background in Python, Java, and C++. These languages are widely used and give me a good knowledge base to learn from. The wide spectrum of topics included in the Computer Science program have laid the foundation for me to have a great career in the field.
	
  Throughout the program there were various projects that required teamwork and communication. In one instance, a requirement was to develop a plan for increasing sales for a particular company. This required communicating with the client to obtain relevant data including surveys, sales data, and other pertinent information. From there, we were asked to work with others in a group to analyze the data and present a path to success. This situation not only improved data analysis and software techniques, but also helped with collaboration between colleagues and communication with clients to attain the goal.
	
  The Computer Science program gives participants a solid fundamental understanding of data structures and algorithms. The knowledge of algorithms help a Computer Science professional in many ways. The discrete mathematics and linear algebra classes have imparted an understanding of basic algorithms including sorting arrays and searching portions of arrays. This is a solid foundation from with to build upon and implement stronger and more beneficial algorithms.
	
  Software engineering and database management were a large portion of the program as well. Reverse engineering gave me a better understanding for assembly language and how data is read by a computer. Taking a project that was presented only in assembly, and reverse engineering that project to C++ was the basis for my final project. Learning the fundamentals of databases was an extremely important aspect of the program as well. Interfacing programs with databases is very beneficial for data storage and usage in the Computer Science field.
	
  The artifact I have chosen for my final project showcases the level of knowledge I have obtained throughout the Computer Science program. It was initially written in C++, and was reverse engineered from assembly. It is a program that stores clients names, and whether they have a brokerage account or retirement account with the user. At the time I wrote the program in C++ I had very little experience with it, and while it worked functionally, it didn’t have the functions that many modern programs need. Because of this I felt it was the perfect subject for my final project. I improved upon the syntax, formatting, and introduced new features such as a database, basic encryption, login features, CRUD functionality and more. It has been drastically improved over its first iteration, and I am proud of the result.



## Milestone 1: Code Review

This is the first step in the final project. It involves taking the artifact selected for the final project, and reviewing the code for errors or potential improvements. This first step is cruicial to upgrading/improving software, as it is a blunt look at the layout of the code. It is an analysis that documents the areas for improvement.
